'Don't stare at the sun!' was a common myth at the time NAME wasn't convinced though and spent hours intently staring into the blinding light each day. His eyesight couldn't be better.

'Don't divide by 0!' was NAME 's favourite when learning algebra. He passed every exam with flying colours and majored in applied mathematics, dividing by 0 in every single equation.
