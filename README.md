###The game is separated into two modes:

The story takes us through a prepared set of maps and loot. It traditionally begins in a cutscene and ends in a boss fight.

The endless mode allows us to play through semi-randomly generated maps, with random loot.

Death is of course permament, health is scarce and enemies are difficult.

## Story

Best described via the beginning cutscene, it's a story of grand conspiracy and power struggle.
